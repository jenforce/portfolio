          <p>In my professional life, I am a experienced in IT Product
          Management with skills centered around; project management,
          requirements gathering and creation of the artifacts to enable IT.
          Delivering IT also developed great problem solving skills and an
          understanding of the in's and out's of "IT" and what it means to
          provide IT solutions in budget and on time.</p>
          <p>I recently, embarked on a journey to change, change jobs, change
          industry hey change really anything. This page is an example of one
          of those changes and also of my work. My experience in HTML and CCS
          can be counted in weeks at this point, but case in point, its a good
          start and proves I work hard and as with most things its a work in
          progress.</p>
          <p>Oh and when Im not coding I can be found outside, maybe kayaking
          or hiking, the usual stuff, I love food and most kinds of wine too -
          very normal right?</p>
